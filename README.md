# csc369a4
Designed a command line-based file system that can copy, add and delete files/directories, restore deleted files, and diagnose and repair virtual disks if it breaks down  

Required to build the whole program with only system header files. Created recursive functions for adding, deleting, and restoring files/directories to virtual disks. Designed shared helper functions like searching particular directoriesâ€™ location in disks, checking if a path is a valid path.(all directories are stored in the disk).
